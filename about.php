					<h4>Welcome to
						<span>ZST</span>
					</h4>
					<p>Education is the backbone of a nation so from a commitment to our nation
						Zohora Samad Trust established ZST School in 2012 at their own South
						Alekanda, Barishal, Bangladesh premises. At ZST School, our primary
						target is to educate tomorrowâ€™s leaders, by training them with the life skills
						to master the challenges posed by an ever-changing world. In order to
						produce young people with confidence to shape the future, our teachers
						view each member of our student as a unique individual.</p>

					<p>Our school is small so we are able to discover the talents of each one of
						our students. At the same time, our activities are big enough to assist
						students to enrich their academic, cultural and sporting skills. The
						infrastructure of ZST School family-like environment facilitates the essential
						one-on-one tuition and hands-on coaching that allow everyone to thrive.
						We pride ourselves on being able to provide everyone with opportunities to
						participate both within the classroom and beyond its confines; said
						participation, in turn, encourages meaningful personal relationships,
						teamwork and commitment to causes beyond the pursuit and attainment of
						individual prestige.</p>
